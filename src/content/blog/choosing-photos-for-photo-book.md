# How to Choose Photos for Your Photo Book

Selecting photos for your photo book can feel overwhelming when you have thousands to choose from. This guide will help you curate the perfect collection that tells your story beautifully.

## The Golden Rules

1. **Quality over quantity**: 50 great photos beat 200 mediocre ones
2. **Tell a story**: Photos should flow and connect
3. **Mix perspectives**: Variety keeps pages interesting
4. **Check technical quality**: Blurry photos won't print well
5. **Consider page layout**: Leave room for design elements

## How Many Photos Do You Need?

- **8x8" book (36 pages)**: 30-50 photos
- **10x10" book (36 pages)**: 40-70 photos
- **12x12" book (36 pages)**: 50-90 photos

## Step-by-Step Selection Process

### 1. Initial Cull (Reduce by 80%)

Go through all photos and eliminate:
- Duplicates and near-duplicates
- Obviously blurry or poorly lit shots
- Photos with closed eyes
- Unflattering angles
- Photos that don't support your story

### 2. Quality Check (Reduce by 50%)

For remaining photos, check:
- **Sharpness**: Zoom to 100% to check focus
- **Exposure**: Not too dark or blown out
- **Composition**: Well-framed and balanced
- **Resolution**: At least 1200x1800 pixels

### 3. Story Flow (Final Selection)

Arrange by:
- Chronology (weddings, trips, timelines)
- Theme (family, friends, activities)
- Emotion (happy, thoughtful, silly)
- Location (if travel book)

### 4. Balance Check

Ensure variety in:
- Subject distance (close-ups, medium, wide shots)
- Orientation (landscape and portrait)
- People count (solos, couples, groups)
- Activities (action shots and still moments)
- Time of day (morning, afternoon, evening)

## Photo Quality Checklist

✅ **Resolution**: 300 DPI for printing (usually 1800x1200px minimum)
✅ **Focus**: Sharp, not blurry
✅ **Lighting**: Well-lit, not too dark or washed out
✅ **Color**: Natural colors, not oversaturated
✅ **No artifacts**: No pixelation or compression issues
✅ **Crop-friendly**: Important elements aren't at edges

## Storytelling Techniques

### The Hero Shot
Start with your absolute best, most impactful photo.

### Building Narrative
- **Beginning**: Set the scene
- **Middle**: Show the action/development
- **End**: Conclude with a memorable moment

### Emotional Arc
Vary emotional tone throughout to keep engagement high.

## Common Selection Mistakes

❌ Including every photo "just because"
❌ All photos look the same (same angle, distance, lighting)
❌ Only posed photos (mix with candids!)
❌ Forgetting to include yourself if you're the photographer
❌ Ignoring "in-between" moments (often the best!)
❌ Not checking photos at print size

## Pro Tips

### For Family Albums
- Include multiple generations
- Mix formal portraits with candid moments
- Don't forget pets!
- Include photos of everyday life, not just special events

### For Travel Books
- Capture architecture and landscapes
- Include local people and street scenes
- Photograph food and cultural details
- Don't forget selfies and group shots at landmarks

### For Wedding Albums
- Mix professional and guest photos
- Include getting-ready moments
- Capture venue details
- Include candid emotion (tears, laughter)

## Organizing Your Selected Photos

### File Naming
Rename files chronologically:
- `01_cover.jpg`
- `02_morning.jpg`
- `03_ceremony.jpg`

### Folder Structure
```
My Photo Book/
  ├── Selected/
  │   ├── Cover
  │   ├── Introduction
  │   ├── Chapter 1
  │   └── Conclusion
  └── Alternates/
```

### Rating System
Use star ratings in photo management software:
- 5 stars: Must include
- 4 stars: Strong candidates
- 3 stars: Backups

## Conclusion

Choosing photos for your photo book is about curation, not inclusion. Be ruthless in your selection, focus on quality and storytelling, and your photo book will be a treasure for years to come.
