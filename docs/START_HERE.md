## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**No bullshit:**
- No fake AI magic
- No complex editors
- No hidden fees
- No dark patterns

**Just:**
- Upload photos → Get beautiful book → Pay $39 → Done

That's it. That's the product.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why delete the old codebase?**
A: It was built on wrong assumptions (fabricjs, messy UX). Clean slate = faster progress.

**Q: Can I start coding now?**
A: Read PRD.md + TECHNICAL_SPEC.md first. Then yes.

**Q: Do I need a designer?**
A: UX_FLOW.md has wireframes. Use shadcn/ui components. You can build without custom design.

**Q: How long to MVP?**
A: 8 weeks for solo developer, 4 weeks for 2-person team (see ROADMAP.md).

**Q: What if I want to change something?**
A: Update the relevant .md file first, then code. Docs are source of truth.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: Yes. This is a complete, shippable product spec. Just needs implementation.

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

**Must-haves for MVP:**
1. ✅ Upload works reliably (99%+ success rate)
2. ✅ Books look professional (quality >> quantity)
3. ✅ Checkout is frictionless (<60 seconds)
4. ✅ Print quality is excellent (no QA misses)
5. ✅ Speed is fast (<3 min total time)

**Nice-to-haves (defer if needed):**
- Manual editing
- Theme customization
- Google Photos import
- User accounts

**The rule:** If it doesn't directly increase conversion or reduce support, cut it.
